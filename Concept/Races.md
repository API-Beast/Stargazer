# Race-Archetypes

Invidual races are generated randomly, but match the behaviour of one of these archetypes. These Archetypes are necessary to make the exploration of the world more interesting.

## Mammaloids

Indecisive race, wars between the invidual mammaloid races constantly emerge and end. May decide to try to conquer a planet of another race even if they pose no threat (like Insectoids).

Loyality of invidual ships changes over time. (E.g. what race they feel to belong to, and wheter they follow their captain or their race in case of a Dilema.)

Conquered Technoid and Mammaloid planets are partially assimilated. That mean that the planet will spawn both ship classes of both the old and the new race. (Both of course loyal to the new race.)

Conquered Insectoid planets will be wiped and rebuild, meaning that at the beginning no ships get spawned, and New-Race ships production is ramped up over time.

## Technoids

Very aggressive, always expanding. Hostile towards all races, including other technoid races.

Invidual ships are 100% loyal to their captain. They will follow any order of their captain, even if it goes against their own race.)

Conquered Technoid planets are gradually assimilated over time, the ship types depend on level of assimilation, when fully assimilated only ship classes of the new race are spawned, otherwise ship classes of the old race are also spawned.

Conquered Non-Technoid planets will be wiped.

## Insectoids

Reactive, most of the time they only protect their own planets without expanding. Go into a expansive state when threatened too much.

Invidual ships are 100% loyal to their own race. In a Dilema they will always chose to help their race instead of their captain.

All conquered planets are wiped.

# Mini-Race Brainstorming

- Spectrals? Can control any planet without needing to assimilate or wipe it. Spooky. Maybe make them give controlled ships some kind of bonus?
- Swarms? Live on ships, planets are not conquered, only wiped which produces some additional ships. Very powerful but unable to control the universe.
